## INTRODUCTION

The Tour Media module will help me attach images to my bicycle tours.
This module is not for general consumption as it is part of my custom setup.

Given a directory of images already on the server. this module will import them as media entities, and attach them to a tour.

## REQUIREMENTS

The Media Image bundle has been extended to include two additional fields:

    field_category -> reference to a taxonomy term
    field_tour -> reference to a tour node


## INSTALLATION

Code lives at https://github.com/lieb77/tour_media
